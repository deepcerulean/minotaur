# Minotaur

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/deepcerulean/minotaur)

Labyrinth-generating and solving framework framework.

A somewhat loose adaptation of jamis' approaches
(e.g., here: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking)

Note that generators/solvers are given symmetrically as 'extruders' (passage-carvers, generators) and 'pathfinders' (solvers)
